# Current development state

Updated: 2026-10-14 (Asia/Bangkok).
Branch: `development/voxel-continuous`.
Starting source commit: `0737017248bbc07e78749b297c384c0b1eceb1d8`.
Task: D001 — establish safe resumable development and local verification.
Status: completed.

## Observed

- Existing main, phase4a-vps and rebuild-p0-p8 branches were inspected. The rebuild contains modular client/server code, isolated staging tooling and existing regression tests; selected as the development base.
- Existing workflow only auto-triggers for its own workflow-file changes on rebuild-p0-p8. No workflow was added or triggered; no deployment command was run.
- Historical notes mention deployed staging, while the committed configuration is a disabled scaffold. Actual account environment state remains unverified.
- GitHub is connected. Codex Cloud is not required for this workflow. No Cloudflare/Firebase mutation or production change occurred.

## Verification performed in this checkout

- `npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund`: passed (42 packages).
- `npm test`: passed, including active behavior/security suites, unchanged historical checkpoint assertions and both legacy multiplayer scenarios.
- `npm run check:client`, `npm run check:syntax`, `npm run check:static`, `npm run staging:check`, `node scripts/rebuild/check-secrets.cjs`: passed.
- Added local `verify-development.cjs`: fixed verification steps, branch guard, per-step logs, timeout/failure handling, source commit and dirty-state report. No deployment path.
- `node --test tests/rebuild/development-runner.test.cjs`: 5 passed, 0 failed; covers complete success, nonzero exit, signal, timeout and unknown exit.
- `node --check scripts/rebuild/verify-development.cjs` and `git diff --check`: passed.
- End-to-end `node scripts/rebuild/verify-development.cjs`: all six steps passed on the modified checkout (dirty=true), completed at 2026-10-14T07:39:37Z. Active suite now includes the five runner tests in addition to the 489 baseline active tests.
- A GitHub-backed hourly scheduled task was created and enabled. It reads current HEAD and these records before each bounded iteration, uses an expected-head lease and suppresses repeat notifications for unchanged blockers. Future execution/tools/model availability are not yet proven by a completed scheduled run.
- Browser, real Google login, deployed staging and physical mobile tests were not run in this iteration. No capacity or production readiness claim.

## Next bounded task

D002: inspect staging handoff/reconnect regressions for an uncovered,
reproducible defect. Read existing tests before changing code. If no defect is
found, document the scoped audit and proceed to the next plan item rather than
inventing changes or duplicating the rebuild.

## External blockers / owner actions

No owner action is needed for the next local audit. Live infrastructure access,
staging mutations, merchant sandbox activation and production deployment remain
separate authorization boundaries. Scheduled task model selection is not exposed
by the automation tool; GPT-6 Astra Medium cannot be guaranteed for future runs.
